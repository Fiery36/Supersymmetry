## How to Contribute to Supersymmetry

# Code style:

Please make sure that you cite your sources in code files for easier verification (page numbers and links). This will especially help with the pull request process.
For each chain, try to keep the recipes within files without mixing.
Otherwise, if you think your code might possibly be reused, we recommend leaving descriptive comments at minimum.

# Molar conventions

- The number of items of dust in a mole of the dust should equal the number of atoms in the molecular unit of the material.
- One mole of a solution should have the same volume as the original solvent used.

# What we would really appreciate:

Right now, we have our project goals on our organization's Projects page. Currently, we are moving to ClickUp, so please communicate with _onionator on our Discord for access.
- Blender models (especially for UV mappings)
- Textures (ask around on our discord)

For anything else, please contact epicergaming02/Epix7 on our Discord.
